# User's Manual
This is a visual fractal program that produces different types of fractals.

To use:
	1) Once in the Current Working Directory of the project, type $ src\main.py  into the command line to see all the available fractals the program can make.
	2) To draw a specific fractal, type $ src\main.py FRACTALNAME

You will notice that certain fractals will draw more slowly. This will happen because they are julia type fractals and will have higher resolution and detail.

One more program tha exist is the Interactive version.
This program has a lower resolution, but allows the user to click on the screen and uncover the fractal one square at a time. If you want to see the entire fractal, right click or press the space bar

To use:
	1) Once in the Current Working Directory of the project, type $ src\interactive.py  into the command line to see all the available fractals the program can make.
	2) To draw a specific fractal, type $ src\interactive.py FRACTALNAME

HAVE FUN!!! :)
